Medical Image Segmentation using  deep learning
With a lot of research on this project, the project is being developed with various technologies of Data Learning and Machine Learning.
As this project requires segmenting the data so for this various segmentation techniques have been studied and
I found that neural network-based segmentation was proven best.
The main objective of this project is segmenting the body parts in a given image.
For example, if an image is given of the abdominal region than it would segment the parts of abdominal region like bone,liver etc.
For achieving this objective, the model must be trained with deep learning techniques
like convolutional neural network, U-Net architecture by using various types of libraries of Python.
This project has gone through testing process for error detection as it will be helpful
in medical field for further analysis of tumor detection, detecting any anomaly present in the bodies 
so that patients can be cure at prior stages.
